# Ancestree

Invite-only, auth-required, collaborative family-tree web app. Relatives add
themselves and their connections into a shared, editable, canvas-style tree.

Product brief and build plan live in the **🌳 Ancestree** Notion teamspace.

## Tech stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router) + React 19 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui (base color: neutral)
- **Font**: Public Sans (`--font-sans`)
- **Backend**: Supabase (Auth / Postgres / Storage) — free tier
- **Hosting**: Vercel (Hobby) at `ancestree.space`
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/arattansi/ancestree
- **Supabase project**: `Product-Ancestree` (`kkmemshpkxrzogijxgnb`, ca-central-1, Free)
- **Tree UI**: React Flow (`@xyflow/react`) + dagre auto-layout (added in Step 6)

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — start dev server
- `npm run build` — production build
- `npm run lint` — ESLint
- `supabase db push` — apply local migrations to the linked remote project
- `supabase start` — local stack (requires Docker Desktop)

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — client + server
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — server-only, never sent to the client
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` — base URL for magic-link redirects and invite links

Until Supabase env is set, `proxy.ts` no-ops so the app still boots. With env
set, unauthenticated visits to `/tree` redirect to `/join`.

## Project structure

- `app/` — App Router pages: `/` landing, `/join` (+ `/join/[token]` invite accept),
  `/auth/callback` (magic-link handler) + `/auth/auth-code-error`, `/onboarding`
  (first-run self entry + connect), `/people/new` (add a connected relative),
  `/people/[id]/edit` (owner/creator/admin entry edit), `/tree` (React Flow
  canvas), `/account` (profile + in-app notifications + delete-account),
  `/admin` (admin-only: overview stats + members + disputes + JSON export),
  `/privacy` (public PIPEDA-minded privacy notice), `/trees/new` (Step 9 seam,
  flagged)
- `app/actions/` — server actions (`auth.ts`: magic link (+ consent gate) +
  sign out; `privacy.ts`: `exportTreeData` (admin JSON export) / `deletePerson`
  (admin erasure + storage cleanup) / `deleteAccount` (self-serve, reassigns
  contributions to a founding admin);
  `trees.ts`: `startOwnTree` (Step 9 multi-tree seam);
  `invites.ts`: mint invite link, grant/revoke `can_invite`;
  `people.ts`: `addPeopleWithConnections` (transactional multi-person + edge
  create), update person, drag-to-pin position, photo + document writes,
  signed URLs; `claims.ts`: `claimPerson` / `disputeClaim` / `resolveClaim` /
  `markNotificationsRead`; `entry-comments.ts`: `getEntryComments` /
  `addEntryComment` / `resolveEntryFlag` / `setEntryVerified`)
- `components/tree/` — `family-tree.tsx` React Flow canvas, `person-node.tsx`
  custom node (open-flag badge + verified `✓`), `person-panel.tsx` detail Sheet
  (edit link + claim / dispute + admin verify), `entry-comments.tsx` (comment /
  flag thread + resolve), `claim-suggestions.tsx` "Is this you?" canvas prompt
- `components/notifications-list.tsx` (account) + `admin-disputed-claims.tsx`
  (admin uphold / reverse); `lib/claims.ts` — claim candidates, notifications,
  disputed-claim queries; `lib/entry-comments.ts` — comment/flag thread reads
- `components/ui/` — shadcn primitives (incl. `form` = react-hook-form + zod)
- `components/person-fields.tsx` — shared demographic fieldset; `person-form.tsx` —
  edit an existing entry; `add-person-flow.tsx` — self / relative add with chain
  connect; `relationship-picker.tsx` — search-select an existing member;
  `components/person-documents.tsx`
- `lib/person-schema.ts` — shared zod schema; `lib/connections.ts` — chain/edge
  types + `buildChainEdges`; `lib/siblings.ts` — sibling inference; `lib/tree.ts` —
  shared-tree + member lookups + `getTreeGraph` (canvas data);
  `lib/tree-layout.ts` — pure dagre auto-layout; `lib/person-name.ts` — display
  name + lifespan + initials; `lib/image.ts` — client-side photo downscale;
  `lib/flags.ts` — build-time feature flags (`multiTreeEnabled`)
- `components/start-tree-form.tsx` — Step 9 "start your own tree" form;
  `components/ui/skeleton.tsx` + `app/{tree,admin,account}/loading.tsx` skeletons
- `lib/auth.ts` — `getUser` / `getProfile` / `requireProfile` / `requireSelfPerson` / `requireAdmin` (server-only)
- `lib/site-url.ts` — `getSiteUrl()` for magic-link redirects and invite links
- `lib/supabase/` — `client.ts` (browser), `server.ts` (RSC/actions), `middleware.ts` (session refresh), `admin.ts` (service role, server-only)
- `lib/database.types.ts` — generated Supabase types (regenerate after schema changes)
- `supabase/` — local CLI project linked to `kkmemshpkxrzogijxgnb` (`Product-Ancestree`)

## Conventions

- shadcn primitives + semantic tokens only (no raw hex). Mobile-first, WCAG AA.
- All DB DDL via the Supabase MCP (`apply_migration`, sanity-checked with `execute_sql`).
- Every table RLS-scoped via `profiles.auth_user_id = auth.uid()`.
- Private storage buckets (`photos`, `documents`) served via signed URLs.
- Commit prefix: `Ancestree v1 (step/total): <subject>`.

## Data model

Applied on Product-Ancestree (`kkmemshpkxrzogijxgnb`). Local source of truth:
`supabase/migrations/`.

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `trees` | Multi-tree-ready container (v1 uses one shared tree) |
| `profiles` | `auth.users` row: `role` (`admin` \| `member`), `can_invite`, `self_person_id` |
| `people` | Demographic nodes; `owner_user_id` starts as `created_by` and moves on claim |
| `relationships` | Directed `parent` edges; undirected `spouse` pairs; siblings inferred |
| `invites` | Shareable tokens (`active` \| `accepted` \| `revoked`) |
| `claims` | Auto-approve / dispute / reject a person entry (`dispute_reason`, `resolved_by`) |
| `notifications` | In-app notices (`claim_*`, `entry_commented` \| `entry_flagged` \| `flag_resolved` \| `entry_verified`); recipient-scoped RLS |
| `entry_comments` | Comments and flags (`is_flag`, `open` \| `resolved`, `resolved_by`) |
| `documents` | Metadata for private file uploads |
| `tree_bridges` | Step 9 seam: links a member's own `trees` row to a tree they belong to via a spouse bridge (feature-flagged; second tree not rendered) |

**Checks:** `people` requires given **or** preferred name, family name, country of
birth, and `is_deceased` (NOT NULL). `lineage_type` is writable by admins only.
`maiden_name` is an optional nullable text column, visible to and editable by any
member who can already edit the entry.

**RLS:** every public table. Members read rows in trees they belong to (admin,
tree creator, accepted invite, or `self_person`). Writes use
`profiles.auth_user_id = auth.uid()`. Person edits (`private.can_edit_person`):
current `owner_user_id`, an admin, **or** the original `created_by` while the
entry is still unclaimed (owner unchanged, no approved claim). Deletes: admin
only. A claim moves `owner_user_id` to the claimant, so the creator then loses
edit rights until an admin reverses the claim.

**Storage:** private buckets `photos` and `documents`. Object path
`{tree_id}/{person_id}/{filename}`. Members can read via signed URLs; only the
entry owner/admin can write.

Helpers live in the unexposed `private` schema (`is_admin`, `is_tree_member`,
`can_edit_person`).

## Auth & invites (Step 3)

- **Magic-link only** (`supabase.auth.signInWithOtp`). `proxy.ts` redirects
  unauthenticated visits to protected routes → `/join`; authenticated users
  without a member profile → `/join?status=pending`.
- **`/auth/callback`** exchanges the code (or verifies the OTP hash), then either
  `redeem_invite(token)` (invite flow) or `ensure_profile()` (admin bootstrap).
- **Invite tokens** (`public.invites`): `can_invite` members + admins mint a
  single-use, 14-day link `"/join/<token>"` by inserting a row directly under RLS
  (`can_invite_to_tree`). `redeem_invite` (SECURITY DEFINER) creates the member
  `profiles` row with `invited_by_user_id = invite.created_by` and flips the
  invite to `accepted`. `invite_preview(token)` is the only pre-auth RPC.
- **Admin bootstrap**: `private.admin_allowlist(email)` — seeded with both
  co-admins (Aalim Rattansi, Raiya Suleman). First login by an
  allowlisted email runs `ensure_profile`, which creates the single shared
  `trees` row and an `admin` / `can_invite` profile. Non-allowlisted users
  without an invite get `needs_invite`.
- **`profiles_protect_role`** trigger still pins role/`can_invite` for
  non-admins; the SECURITY DEFINER helpers set a `LOCAL`
  `ancestree.privileged_profile_write` GUC to bypass it during bootstrap only.
- **`public.member_directory`** view (`security_invoker`) = profiles + resolved
  `invited_by_name`; drives `/admin` and `/account`.

**Supabase dashboard config (do once):** Authentication → URL Configuration →
Site URL `https://ancestree.space`; Redirect URLs allowlist
`http://localhost:3000/**`, `https://ancestree.space/**`,
`https://*-arattansi.vercel.app/**`. Email provider = built-in for now (free
tier ~3–4/hour) — swap to an SMTP provider before wider testing.

## Privacy & compliance (Step 10)

Family data (living people, DOB, photos, documents) is treated as sensitive PII;
Canadian context → PIPEDA-minded.

- **Consent at registration**: the magic-link form has a required consent
  checkbox linking to `/privacy`; `requestMagicLink` rejects the request without
  it. `/privacy` is in `proxy.ts`'s public prefixes so it is readable pre-auth.
- **All PII behind auth + RLS**: every table is RLS-scoped by tree membership;
  nothing is public or indexed. Photos/documents live in private buckets and are
  only ever served through short-lived signed URLs (unchanged from Step 2).
- **Admin data export**: `/admin` → "Download JSON export"
  (`exportTreeData`, service-role read of every table scoped to the shared tree;
  `components/admin-export.tsx` streams it as a client-side download).
- **Delete a person**: `PersonPanel` → "Delete entry" (admins only,
  `deletePerson`) removes the row (edges cascade) plus its photo and document
  objects from storage.
- **Delete your account**: `/account` → "Delete my account" (`deleteAccount`)
  removes the auth user + `profiles` row after reassigning the member's
  `created_by` / `owner_user_id` / `uploaded_by` references to a founding admin,
  so the shared record stays intact. Blocked if the caller is the only admin.
- **Free-tier headroom**: photos are downscaled client-side to ≤1280px JPEG
  (`lib/image.ts#compressImage`, wired in the add + edit forms); documents are
  capped at 10MB/file client-side (`person-documents.tsx`), well under the
  Supabase Free limits (50MB/file, 1GB storage, 500MB DB). No `console.*` calls
  anywhere in `app/` `lib/` `components/` — no PII in logs.

## v1 acceptance checklist

All Product Brief items pass as of Step 10: invite-gated magic-link auth with
inviter-attributed links; onboarding self-entry + connection (chain-add);
demographic form with required-field + conditional-deceased validation; private
photo + multi-document upload via signed URLs; admin-only lineage; React Flow +
dagre canvas with custom nodes, pan/zoom, detail panel; edit gating
(creator/owner/admin) + admin delete; claim flow (detect on register,
auto-approve, notify creator, creator lockout); flag/comment + resolve/verify;
multi-tree "start your own tree" stub; mobile-first + WCAG AA. Deploy to
`ancestree.space` via Vercel (`git push` → production on `main`).

## Changelog

- **Step 11 — Optional maiden name** (migration
  `20260830250000_person_maiden_name`): new nullable `people.maiden_name text`
  column (no default; existing rows stay NULL). `add_people_with_connections`
  re-created to persist it on create. Shared zod schema
  (`lib/person-schema.ts`) gains an optional `maiden_name` (≤120 chars, blank OK)
  wired into `toPersonPayload` + `emptyPersonValues`; `PersonFields` shows a
  "Maiden name" input beside the other name fields (not admin-gated), so it
  appears in both the edit form and the add-a-relative flow. `updatePerson`
  writes it. Detail panel (`PersonPanel`) shows "Maiden name" when set and — for
  an editor of an entry with no maiden name — a subtle dashed inline prompt
  linking to the edit form (opt-in, per-person, non-blocking; gated by the same
  creator/owner/admin `canEdit`). The **canvas `PersonNode` does not** display
  it. Search: `listTreeMembers` + `TreeMemberOption` carry `maidenName`, and the
  `RelationshipPicker` search box matches it alongside the display name (and
  shows "· née …" on matching rows). `lib/database.types.ts` regenerated.

- **Step 10 — Privacy, acceptance & ship**: no migration. Consent gate on the
  magic-link form + `/privacy` notice; admin JSON export, admin delete-person
  (+ storage cleanup), self-serve delete-account (`app/actions/privacy.ts`,
  `components/{admin-export,delete-account}.tsx`); 10MB document cap; full v1
  acceptance checklist verified. `proxy.ts` public prefixes gain `/privacy`.
- **Step 9 — Multi-tree seam, polish & admin dashboard** (migration
  `20260830240000_multi_tree_seam`): new `tree_bridges` table (RLS: members of
  either side) + `start_own_tree(name, bridge_person_id, person)` SECURITY
  DEFINER RPC that creates a member's own `trees` row, their root `people` row
  in it, and one spouse bridge back to a person on a tree they already belong
  to (one per member). Gated by `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_MULTI_TREE` via
  `lib/flags.ts#multiTreeEnabled`; the second tree is **not** drawn — this is a
  clean seam for v2. UI: `/trees/new` (`components/start-tree-form.tsx`,
  `app/actions/trees.ts#startOwnTree`), plus a flagged "Start your own tree"
  button on the canvas. Polish: `components/ui/skeleton.tsx` +
  `app/{tree,admin,account}/loading.tsx` route skeletons, wrapping/focus-ring
  fixes in `site-header.tsx`. Admin dashboard (`/admin`): an Overview stat grid
  (members, entries, relationships, claimed, unverified, open flags, disputes,
  bridges) and a per-member "Entries created" column.
- **Step 8 — Entry comments, flags & verification** (migration
  `20260830230000`): `people` gains `verified_at` / `verified_by`;
  `entry_comments` gains `resolved_at` / `resolved_by`. Any tree member can
  comment or raise a flag (`is_flag`) — inserted directly under the existing
  `entry_comments` RLS (optimistic UI). An `AFTER INSERT/UPDATE` trigger
  (`private.entry_comment_notify`) posts an in-app `notifications` row to the
  entry's `owner_user_id` + `created_by` on every comment/flag, and to the
  flag's author when it is resolved (new notification types `entry_commented`,
  `entry_flagged`, `flag_resolved`, `entry_verified`). `resolve_entry_flag()`
  (owner / admin / flag author) toggles a flag open↔resolved; the
  `entry_comments_update` policy is widened so the entry owner can moderate.
  `set_entry_verified()` (admins only) stamps verification and notifies. UI:
  `EntryComments` panel section (thread + composer + resolve), open-flag badge
  on `PersonNode` + panel header, `✓` verified marker on the node, admin
  "Mark verified" in the panel. `getTreeGraph` now also loads open-flag counts;
  `lib/entry-comments.ts` resolves author/resolver names.
- **Step 7 — Claiming & permissions** (migration `20260830220000`): edit gating
  is now owner / admin / unclaimed-creator (`private.can_edit_person` +
  `private.person_is_claimed`), enforced by the existing `people_update` policy
  and re-checked in the `/people/[id]/edit` route. `person_claim_candidates()`
  surfaces unclaimed same-name entries; `claim_person()` (SECURITY DEFINER)
  auto-approves — moves `owner_user_id`, repoints `profiles.self_person_id`,
  merges the caller's onboarding stub (relationships / documents / comments /
  photo) and deletes it, writes an `approved` `claims` row, and notifies the
  creator. `dispute_claim()` (creator only) → `disputed`, routed to admins;
  `resolve_claim(uphold|reverse)` (admin) restores ownership + detaches the
  claimant on reverse. New `notifications` table + `private.notify()`; abuse
  controls: 5 claims / 24h / user, server-side name-match re-check, admin-only
  reversal. UI: `ClaimSuggestions` canvas prompt, claim/dispute in
  `PersonPanel`, account `NotificationsList` (+ header unread badge), admin
  `AdminDisputedClaims`.
- **Step 6 — Tree visualization (canvas)**: `/tree` is now a React Flow
  (`@xyflow/react`) + dagre canvas. `lib/tree.ts#getTreeGraph` loads all people
  (with 1h signed photo URLs) + relationship edges for the shared tree;
  `lib/tree-layout.ts#layoutTree` is a pure, client-safe dagre pass — top-down by
  generation, with invisible "union" nodes tying couples to one rank and hanging
  their children from a shared point; pinned `people.pos_x/pos_y` override the
  auto position. `components/tree/`: `family-tree.tsx` (canvas + pan/zoom /
  minimap / controls, drag-to-pin via `setPersonPosition` server action),
  `person-node.tsx` (photo/initials, display name, lifespan, dashed deceased
  styling, self-highlight), `person-panel.tsx` (shadcn Sheet — full details,
  documents, disabled Edit/Claim stubs for Steps 7–8). Empty state links into
  the Step 5 onboarding / add-relative flow. New dep: `dagre`.
- **Step 5 — Connections & add-person flow**: `add_people_with_connections`
  SECURITY DEFINER RPC (migration `20260830210000`) creates one or more people
  plus their `parent`/`spouse` edges in a single transaction, links the caller's
  `self_person_id` when `p_self_index` is set, guards against parent/child cycles
  (recursive walk), and — for non-admins — rejects the write unless every new
  person reaches a pre-existing tree member (admins seed roots freely). Replaces
  `create_self_person` (dropped). `sibling_edges` security-invoker view exposes
  sibling pairs from shared parents; `lib/siblings.ts` mirrors it client-side.
  New `AddPersonFlow` (self + relative modes) with `RelationshipPicker`
  search-select and inline chain-add of missing in-between people; `/onboarding`
  now requires a connection, `/people/new` adds relatives. `PersonForm` is now
  edit-only; demographic fields extracted to `PersonFields`.
- **Step 4 — Person form & onboarding**: reusable `PersonForm` (shadcn Form +
  zod, `lib/person-schema.ts`); required = (given|preferred) + family +
  country_of_birth + explicit `is_deceased`; death fields revealed on the
  Deceased checkbox; admin-only Lineage select. Client-side photo
  downscale (`lib/image.ts`) → `photos` bucket; multi-file Documents section
  (`person-documents.tsx`) → `documents` bucket with signed-URL download +
  remove. First-run onboarding at `/onboarding` (guarded by
  `requireSelfPerson`) creates the member's own person via the
  `create_self_person` SECURITY DEFINER RPC (migration `20260830200539`) which
  also sets `profiles.self_person_id`. `next.config.ts` allows the Supabase
  Storage image host.
- **Step 3 — Auth & invite system**: magic-link auth + invite-gated
  registration; `redeem_invite` / `ensure_profile` / `invite_preview` RPCs +
  `admin_allowlist` bootstrap (both co-admins seeded) + `member_directory` view
  (migrations `20260830192758`, `20260830192832`, `20260830194512`); `/join`, `/join/[token]`,
  `/auth/callback`, `/account`, `/admin`; `lib/auth.ts`, `lib/site-url.ts`,
  `app/actions/{auth,invites}.ts`; auth-aware `SiteHeader`.
- **Step 2 — Data model, RLS & storage**: `supabase init` + link to
  Product-Ancestree; first migrations for all tables, RLS, and private
  `photos` / `documents` buckets; generated `lib/database.types.ts`.
- **Step 1 — Repo & infra bootstrap**: Next.js 16 + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui
  scaffold; Public Sans; Supabase client/server/middleware/admin helpers
  (env-guarded); `.env.example`; landing + `/tree` placeholder + `/join`;
  GitHub repo `arattansi/ancestree`; Product-Ancestree (`kkmemshpkxrzogijxgnb`);
  Vercel Hobby project `ancestree` (`prj_tfdWlxVA1Wu6tbiLquXMjso5wTap`) +
  `ancestree.space` / `www.ancestree.space`; this doc.

**Step 1 infra notes:** `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is server-only. Set it in
`.env.local` and Vercel from Supabase Project Settings → API (service_role).
Do not commit it. Preview env vars may need a git branch in this CLI version.
