# Ancestree

Invite-only, auth-required, collaborative family-tree web app. Relatives add
themselves and their connections into a shared, editable, canvas-style tree.

Product brief and build plan live in the **🌳 Ancestree** Notion teamspace.

## Tech stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router) + React 19 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui (base color: neutral)
- **Font**: Public Sans (`--font-sans`)
- **Backend**: Supabase (Auth / Postgres / Storage) — free tier
- **Hosting**: Vercel (Hobby) at `ancestree.space`
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/arattansi/ancestree
- **Supabase project**: `Product-Ancestree` (`kkmemshpkxrzogijxgnb`, ca-central-1, Free)
- **Tree UI**: React Flow (`@xyflow/react`) + a purpose-built anchored auto-layout
  (Step 6; replaced dagre in Step 4.6)

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — start dev server
- `npm run build` — production build
- `npm run lint` — ESLint
- `supabase db push` — apply local migrations to the linked remote project
- `supabase start` — local stack (requires Docker Desktop)

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — client + server
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — server-only, never sent to the client
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` — base URL for magic-link redirects and invite links

Until Supabase env is set, `proxy.ts` no-ops so the app still boots. With env
set, unauthenticated visits to `/tree` redirect to `/join`.

## Project structure

- `app/` — App Router pages: `/` landing, `/join` (+ `/join/[token]` invite accept),
  `/auth/callback` (magic-link handler) + `/auth/auth-code-error`, `/onboarding`
  (first-run self entry + connect), `/people/new` (add a connected relative),
  `/people/[id]/edit` (owner/creator/admin entry edit), `/tree` (React Flow
  canvas), `/account` (profile + in-app notifications + delete-account),
  `/admin` (admin-only: overview stats + members + invite requests + disputes +
  JSON export), `/request-invite` (public: ask an admin for an invite),
  `/privacy` (public PIPEDA-minded privacy notice), `/trees/new` (Step 9 seam,
  flagged)
- `app/actions/` — server actions (`auth.ts`: magic link (+ consent gate) +
  sign out; `privacy.ts`: `exportTreeData` (admin JSON export) / `deletePerson`
  (admin erasure + storage cleanup) / `deleteAccount` (self-serve, reassigns
  contributions to a founding admin);
  `trees.ts`: `startOwnTree` (Step 9 multi-tree seam);
  `invites.ts`: mint invite link, grant/revoke `can_invite`;
  `invite-requests.ts`: `requestInvite` (public, service-role write) /
  `approveInviteRequest` (mints the link) / `declineInviteRequest`;
  `people.ts`: `addPeopleWithConnections` (transactional multi-person + edge
  create), update person, drag-to-pin position, photo + document writes,
  signed URLs; `claims.ts`: `claimPerson` / `disputeClaim` / `resolveClaim` /
  `markNotificationsRead`; `entry-comments.ts`: `getEntryComments` /
  `addEntryComment` / `resolveEntryFlag` / `setEntryVerified`)
- `components/tree/` — `family-tree.tsx` React Flow canvas (generation lanes
  behind the cards; a child's descent line starts from a junction *derived from
  its parents' live positions* — not a node — so it follows them as they are
  dragged, and all of a couple's children bend at a shared horizontal bus, so a
  marriage shows one trunk rather than one line per parent; admin
  "Auto-arrange" clears every manual nudge), `person-node.tsx`
  custom node (name, then `née` maiden name / birth year / birthplace;
  open-flag badge + verified `✓`), `person-panel.tsx` detail Sheet
  (edit link + claim / dispute + admin verify), `entry-comments.tsx` (comment /
  flag thread + resolve), `claim-suggestions.tsx` "Is this you?" canvas prompt
- `components/notifications-list.tsx` (account) + `admin-disputed-claims.tsx`
  (admin uphold / reverse); `lib/claims.ts` — claim candidates, notifications,
  disputed-claim queries; `lib/entry-comments.ts` — comment/flag thread reads
- `components/ui/` — shadcn primitives (incl. `form` = react-hook-form + zod)
- `components/person-fields.tsx` — shared demographic fieldset; `person-form.tsx` —
  edit an existing entry; `add-person-flow.tsx` — self / relative add with chain
  connect; `relationship-picker.tsx` — search-select an existing member;
  `place-autocomplete.tsx` — `places`-backed birth/death location picker
  (+ admin "add a place"); `components/person-documents.tsx`
- `lib/places.ts` — server-only `searchPlaces` / `getPlacesByIds` /
  `formatPlaceLabel`; `lib/country-names.ts` — `countryName` (ISO→name) +
  `ALPHA2`; `app/actions/places.ts` — `searchPlacesAction` / `requestNewPlace`
  (admin) / `listCountryOptions`; `lib/historical-names.ts` — pure
  `resolveHistoricalName` / `formatHistoricalPlace` (Step 4.5d, `.test.ts`)
- `lib/person-schema.ts` — shared zod schema; `lib/connections.ts` — chain/edge
  types + `buildChainEdges`; `lib/connection-suggestions.ts` — implied-connection
  detection engine (+ `.server.ts` loader, `.test.ts`); `lib/siblings.ts` — sibling inference; `lib/tree.ts` —
  shared-tree + member lookups + `getTreeGraph` (canvas data);
  `lib/tree-layout.ts` — the anchored auto-layout engine (Step 4.6, `.test.ts`):
  generations relative to the founding admins fix `y`, the anchor couple is
  translated to the origin, each admin's bloodline is pushed to its own side of
  it, median sweeps cut edge crossings, and a separation sweep guarantees a
  minimum gap between cards. Couple partners sit side by side eldest-left and a
  sibling set runs oldest→youngest. Also emits generation bands and per-couple
  descent points (`descentGeometry`, shared with the canvas so the drawn line
  and the laid-out one follow one rule); `lib/person-name.ts` — display
  name + lifespan + initials; `lib/image.ts` — client-side photo downscale;
  `lib/flags.ts` — build-time feature flags (`multiTreeEnabled`)
- `components/start-tree-form.tsx` — Step 9 "start your own tree" form;
  `components/ui/skeleton.tsx` + `app/{tree,admin,account}/loading.tsx` skeletons
- `lib/auth.ts` — `getUser` / `getProfile` / `requireProfile` / `requireSelfPerson` / `requireAdmin` (server-only)
- `lib/site-url.ts` — `getSiteUrl()` for magic-link redirects and invite links
- `lib/supabase/` — `client.ts` (browser), `server.ts` (RSC/actions), `middleware.ts` (session refresh), `admin.ts` (service role, server-only)
- `lib/database.types.ts` — generated Supabase types (regenerate after schema changes)
- `supabase/` — local CLI project linked to `kkmemshpkxrzogijxgnb` (`Product-Ancestree`)

## Conventions

- shadcn primitives + semantic tokens only (no raw hex). Mobile-first, WCAG AA.
- All DB DDL via the Supabase MCP (`apply_migration`, sanity-checked with `execute_sql`).
- Every table RLS-scoped via `profiles.auth_user_id = auth.uid()`.
- Private storage buckets (`photos`, `documents`) served via signed URLs.
- Commit prefix: `Ancestree v1 (step/total): <subject>`.

## Data model

Applied on Product-Ancestree (`kkmemshpkxrzogijxgnb`). Local source of truth:
`supabase/migrations/`.

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `trees` | Multi-tree-ready container (v1 uses one shared tree) |
| `profiles` | `auth.users` row: `role` (`admin` \| `member`), `can_invite`, `self_person_id` |
| `people` | Demographic nodes; `owner_user_id` starts as `created_by` and moves on claim. `place_id_birth` / `place_id_death` → `places(id)` (Step 4.5b; nullable, backfilled — legacy `city_of_birth` / `country_of_birth` / `place_of_death` text kept until reconciled) |
| `relationships` | Directed `parent` edges; undirected `spouse` pairs (optional `marriage_date` / `is_divorced` / `divorce_date`, spouse-only by CHECK); siblings inferred |
| `connection_suggestions` | Implied-connection prompts surfaced by the add-person flow (`suggested_type` spouse/parent/sibling_check, `source`, `status` pending/accepted/dismissed); UNIQUE (subject, related, type, source) = no re-prompt |
| `invites` | Shareable tokens (`active` \| `accepted` \| `revoked`) |
| `invite_requests` | Public invite asks — first/last name + email, `pending` \| `approved` \| `declined`, `invite_id` of the link minted on approval. Admin-only RLS; inserted server-side with the service role (no `anon` grant). One pending row per email |
| `claims` | Auto-approve / dispute / reject a person entry (`dispute_reason`, `resolved_by`) |
| `notifications` | In-app notices (`claim_*`, `entry_commented` \| `entry_flagged` \| `flag_resolved` \| `entry_verified`); recipient-scoped RLS |
| `entry_comments` | Comments and flags (`is_flag`, `open` \| `resolved`, `resolved_by`) |
| `documents` | Metadata for private file uploads |
| `places` | GeoNames reference data (populated places + admin areas) for birthplace autocomplete; not tree-scoped — read by any member, written only by the import script |
| `historical_names` | Curated period names for a place/country over a date range (Step 4.5d); matched by `place_id` then `country_code` against a birth/death year. Read by any member; seeded by migration |
| `tree_bridges` | Step 9 seam: links a member's own `trees` row to a tree they belong to via a spouse bridge (feature-flagged; second tree not rendered) |

**Checks:** `people` requires first **or** preferred name, last name, and
`is_deceased` (NOT NULL). The form now requires a **`place_id_birth`** (GeoNames
`places` FK, Step 4.5c) rather than free-text country; `city_of_birth` /
`country_of_birth` are still written (derived from the picked place). `lineage_type` is writable by admins only.
`middle_name` and `maiden_name` are optional nullable text columns, visible to and
editable by any member who can already edit the entry.

**RLS:** every public table. Members read rows in trees they belong to (admin,
tree creator, accepted invite, or `self_person`). Writes use
`profiles.auth_user_id = auth.uid()`. Person edits (`private.can_edit_person`):
current `owner_user_id`, an admin, **or** the original `created_by` while the
entry is still unclaimed (owner unchanged, no approved claim). Deletes: admin
only. A claim moves `owner_user_id` to the claimant, so the creator then loses
edit rights until an admin reverses the claim.

**Storage:** private buckets `photos` and `documents`. Object path
`{tree_id}/{person_id}/{filename}`. Members can read via signed URLs; only the
entry owner/admin can write.

Helpers live in the unexposed `private` schema (`is_admin`, `is_tree_member`,
`can_edit_person`).

## Auth & invites (Step 3)

- **Magic-link only** (`supabase.auth.signInWithOtp`). `proxy.ts` redirects
  unauthenticated visits to protected routes → `/join`; authenticated users
  without a member profile → `/join?status=pending`.
- **`/auth/callback`** exchanges the code (or verifies the OTP hash), then either
  `redeem_invite(token)` (invite flow) or `ensure_profile()` (admin bootstrap).
- **Invite tokens** (`public.invites`): `can_invite` members + admins mint a
  single-use, 14-day link `"/join/<token>"` by inserting a row directly under RLS
  (`can_invite_to_tree`). `redeem_invite` (SECURITY DEFINER) creates the member
  `profiles` row with `invited_by_user_id = invite.created_by` and flips the
  invite to `accepted`. `invite_preview(token)` is the only pre-auth RPC.
- **Invite requests** (`public.invite_requests`): anyone can ask from `/` →
  `/request-invite` with first name, last name, and email. The row is written
  by the `requestInvite` server action using the service-role client, so the
  table needs no `anon` grant or insert policy and cannot be read or enumerated
  from the browser. Admins review pending requests on `/admin`; approving mints
  a normal single-use invite link (attributed to the reviewing admin) and
  emails it to the requester via Resend (`lib/email.ts` +
  `lib/emails/invite-approved.ts`, needs `RESEND_API_KEY`) — if the send
  fails, the invite is still valid and the admin can copy the link and send it
  themselves; declining just closes the request.
- **Admin bootstrap**: `private.admin_allowlist(email)` — seeded with both
  co-admins (Aalim Rattansi, Raiya Suleman). First login by an
  allowlisted email runs `ensure_profile`, which creates the single shared
  `trees` row and an `admin` / `can_invite` profile. Non-allowlisted users
  without an invite get `needs_invite`.
- **`profiles_protect_role`** trigger still pins role/`can_invite` for
  non-admins; the SECURITY DEFINER helpers set a `LOCAL`
  `ancestree.privileged_profile_write` GUC to bypass it during bootstrap only.
- **`public.member_directory`** view (`security_invoker`) = profiles + resolved
  `invited_by_name`; drives `/admin` and `/account`.

**Supabase dashboard config (do once):** Authentication → URL Configuration →
Site URL `https://ancestree.space`; Redirect URLs allowlist
`http://localhost:3000/**`, `https://ancestree.space/**`,
`https://*-arattansi.vercel.app/**`. Email provider = built-in for now (free
tier ~3–4/hour) — swap to an SMTP provider before wider testing.

## Privacy & compliance (Step 10)

Family data (living people, DOB, photos, documents) is treated as sensitive PII;
Canadian context → PIPEDA-minded.

- **Consent at registration**: the magic-link form has a required consent
  checkbox linking to `/privacy`; `requestMagicLink` rejects the request without
  it. `/privacy` is in `proxy.ts`'s public prefixes so it is readable pre-auth.
- **All PII behind auth + RLS**: every table is RLS-scoped by tree membership;
  nothing is public or indexed. Photos/documents live in private buckets and are
  only ever served through short-lived signed URLs (unchanged from Step 2).
- **Admin data export**: `/admin` → "Download JSON export"
  (`exportTreeData`, service-role read of every table scoped to the shared tree;
  `components/admin-export.tsx` streams it as a client-side download).
- **Delete a person**: `PersonPanel` → "Delete entry" (admins only,
  `deletePerson`) removes the row (edges cascade) plus its photo and document
  objects from storage.
- **Delete your account**: `/account` → "Delete my account" (`deleteAccount`)
  removes the auth user + `profiles` row after reassigning the member's
  `created_by` / `owner_user_id` / `uploaded_by` references to a founding admin,
  so the shared record stays intact. Blocked if the caller is the only admin.
- **Free-tier headroom**: photos are downscaled client-side to ≤1280px JPEG
  (`lib/image.ts#compressImage`, wired in the add + edit forms); documents are
  capped at 10MB/file client-side (`person-documents.tsx`), well under the
  Supabase Free limits (50MB/file, 1GB storage, 500MB DB). No `console.*` calls
  anywhere in `app/` `lib/` `components/` — no PII in logs.

## Reference data — GeoNames `places`

Birthplace autocomplete is backed by `public.places`, imported from the
[GeoNames](https://www.geonames.org/) `cities500` export (all populated places
with population ≥ 500).

- **Source dump:** `cities500.zip` → `cities500.txt`, GeoNames "geoname" table
  layout (19 tab-separated columns, no header).
  **Version imported:** `cities500.txt` dated **2024-11-04** (latest
  `modification_date` in the file; re-download from
  `https://download.geonames.org/export/dump/cities500.zip` for a fresher cut).
- **Import command** (needs `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` +
  `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in `.env.local`):

  ```
  npm run import:geonames -- /path/to/cities500.txt
  ```

  `scripts/import-geonames.ts` streams the file, keeps `feature_class IN ('P','A')`,
  and batch-upserts (1000/batch) on `id` via the PostgREST endpoint
  (`Prefer: resolution=merge-duplicates` — no `supabase-js`, so it runs on
  Node 20), so it is safe to re-run. It prints the final `places` row count.
- **Imported:** 2026-08-31 — 235,552 rows (cities500 is entirely
  `feature_class = 'P'`; it contains no `'A'` admin areas — those would need the
  full `allCountries` dump or a dedicated admin export). Spot-checked against
  New York, London, Tokyo, Paris, Buenos Aires; trigram fuzzy search verified
  (e.g. `search_name LIKE '%zurich%'` → index scan, matches `Zürich`).
- **Free-tier size:** `places` measures **58 MB** total (table + the two
  `pg_trgm` GIN indexes + the `country_code` btree); whole DB **70 MB**, well
  under the Supabase Free 500 MB limit. **`allCountries` (~13M rows, ~55×) is
  multiple GB and must not be imported on the free tier.**
- `pg_trgm` lives in the `extensions` schema (not `public`), per the Supabase
  linter — migration `20260831040000_places_trgm_extension_schema`.

## v1 acceptance checklist

All Product Brief items pass as of Step 10: invite-gated magic-link auth with
inviter-attributed links; onboarding self-entry + connection (chain-add);
demographic form with required-field + conditional-deceased validation; private
photo + multi-document upload via signed URLs; admin-only lineage; React Flow

## Changelog

- **Step 4.6 — Anchored tree layout** (migration
  `20260831070000_person_layout_offsets`): replaced the dagre pass with a
  purpose-built engine in `lib/tree-layout.ts` (24 vitest cases). Generations are
  numbered *relative to the founding admins* (`getTreeAnchors()` reads their
  `self_person_id`s), so generation fixes `y` and adding a great-grandparent
  extends the chart upward instead of reflowing it; the anchor couple is
  translated to the canvas origin. Ancestors reachable from only one anchor —
  and their collaterals — are pushed to that anchor's side of the origin, so the
  two bloodlines never interleave. Within a row: seed order by side then degree
  (hubs innermost), four median sweeps to cut crossings, barycentre coordinate
  passes to centre parents over children, then a **separation sweep that
  guarantees** no two cards on a row are closer than `GUTTER` — overlap is
  impossible at any size (tested on a 105-person tree). Couples stay adjacent
  eldest-left; sibling runs go oldest→youngest. The canvas draws generation
  lanes (`ViewportPortal`) labelled by *generation number* rather than by
  relationship — a row also holds the aunts, uncles and in-laws born into it, so
  "Grandparents" would mislabel most of it. Numbers count outward from the
  founders: ancestors up ("Generation One" = parents, "Generation Two" =
  grandparents), descendants down ("Generation minus One" = children); row 0 is
  "Founders' generation". Captioned with the decade span the row actually covers
  ("b. 1950s–1960s" when two sets of parents are a decade apart). Routes every
  child of a parent set through a shared `busY` so a marriage shows one trunk
  plus stubs (`DescentEdge`). That junction is computed by the pure
  `descentGeometry(parentRects, childTop)` from the parents' **live** card
  positions read out of the React Flow store — an invisible junction *node*
  would stay where the layout first put it and detach the moment a parent was
  dragged. It also handles a lone parent and partners dragged apart by dropping
  the start below the cards rather than across a face. Spouse lines are drawn
  level through both cards' vertical middles (`lateralGeometry`), stepping at
  right angles rather than sloping if a partner is dragged off the row; the
  person card is a fixed `NODE_H` tall so cards with different amounts of detail
  can no longer tilt the line between them. Drags now persist as a **nudge** (`pos_dx`/`pos_dy`)
  from the computed position rather than an absolute pin, so a moved card follows
  the tree as it grows; legacy `pos_x`/`pos_y` still win until that card is next
  dragged, and an admin-only **Auto-arrange** (`autoArrangeTree`) clears every
  nudge and pin at once. Dropped dep: `dagre` (+ `@types/dagre`).
- **Step 4.5d — Historical place-name resolution** (migrations
  `20260831060000_historical_names` + `..._seed_east_africa`): new
  `historical_names` table (`place_id` **or** `country_code`, `name`,
  `start_date`/`end_date`, `source`) — a curated, **not** global set. Seeded for
  the regions this tree spans (Tanganyika/German East Africa, Sultanate of
  Zanzibar (place-scoped, GeoNames 148730), Kenya Colony / British East Africa
  Protectorate, Uganda Protectorate, Union of South Africa). `lib/historical-
  names.ts` — pure `resolveHistoricalName(rows, {placeId, countryCode,
  eventDate})` (place-scoped beats country-scoped; `end_date` exclusive) +
  `formatHistoricalPlace` ("Nairobi, Kenya Colony · now Kenya"; no label when
  the period name already equals the modern country). `getTreeGraph` loads the
  table once and sets `birth_place_historical` / `death_place_historical` per
  person from the birth/death year; `PersonPanel` shows those in place of the
  plain birth/death place when present. Vitest: `lib/historical-names.test.ts`.
  Verified against real rows — e.g. Zanzibar 1925 → "Sultanate of Zanzibar",
  Nairobi 1936 → "Kenya Colony", Nairobi 1965 → (modern). Add regions by
  appending to the seed migration.

- **Step 4.5c — Places autocomplete in the person form** (no migration):
  `components/place-autocomplete.tsx` — a Base UI `Combobox` bound to `places`
  via `searchPlacesAction` (debounced trigram search, `app/actions/places.ts`),
  showing "City, ST, Country" (`lib/places.ts#formatPlaceLabel`; `admin1` only
  when GeoNames stored a letter code). `PersonFields` now has a **Place of
  birth** (required — `personSchema` rejects a null `place_id_birth`) and
  **Place of death** picker instead of the free-text city/country/place-of-death
  inputs; picking a place also fills the legacy `city_of_birth` /
  `country_of_birth` / `place_of_death` text (derived, kept until 4.5b's
  columns are dropped). `updatePerson` writes the FKs directly;
  `addPeopleWithConnections` sets them on the new rows right after the RPC (RPC
  signature unchanged). Admin-only escape hatch: "Add a place" dialog →
  `requestNewPlace` (service-role insert, ids ≥ `10_000_000_000` mark
  admin-added). Edit form pre-loads the selected place label via
  `getPlacesByIds`. Detail/canvas views keep rendering the (now canonical)
  text columns. `lib/country-names.ts` — `countryName` + `ALPHA2`. Known gap:
  the flagged `start_own_tree` seam still writes only text (no `place_id`).

- **Step 4.5b — `people` place FKs + backfill** (migration
  `20260831050000_people_place_id_fks`): `people` gains nullable
  `place_id_birth` / `place_id_death` bigint FKs to `places(id)` (+ btree
  indexes). The legacy `city_of_birth` / `country_of_birth` / `place_of_death`
  text columns are **kept** — dropped only in a later follow-up once the
  unmatched rows are reconciled. No CHECK/RLS change (new columns nullable;
  `people` row access already governs them). `scripts/backfill-places.ts`
  (`npm run backfill:places`) fuzzy-matches the free text against `places`
  (trigram-style Dice similarity, ISO-country-filtered via
  `scripts/lib/country-codes.ts`), sets the FK at ≥0.6 confidence, and writes
  the rest to `scripts/out/backfill-places-unmatched.csv` for manual review.
  First run: 12/12 birth + 5/5 death matched, 0 unmatched — but "Scarborough,
  Canada" resolved to *Scarborough Village* (cities500 has no plain
  "Scarborough" for CA), worth a manual check. Types regenerated.

- **Step 4.5a — GeoNames `places` table + importer** (migrations
  `20260831020000_places_geonames`, `20260831040000_places_trgm_extension_schema`):
  new `public.places` reference table (GeoNames `geonameid` PK, `name`,
  `ascii_name`, `country_code`, `admin1_code`, `feature_class` / `feature_code`,
  lat/lon, `population`, and a stored `search_name = lower(ascii_name)` generated
  column). `pg_trgm` enabled in the `extensions` schema; GIN trigram indexes on
  `search_name` and `ascii_name` for fuzzy autocomplete, plus a btree on
  `country_code`. RLS on: `SELECT` for any `authenticated` member, no write
  policies (service-role only). `scripts/import-geonames.ts` (run via
  `npm run import:geonames`) streams the tab-delimited GeoNames dump, filters to
  `feature_class IN ('P','A')`, and idempotently batch-upserts on `id` through
  the PostgREST endpoint. New devDep `tsx`. Imported `cities500` (2024-11-04) =
  235,552 rows, `places` at 58 MB / DB at 70 MB. `lib/database.types.ts`
  regenerated. See **Reference data — GeoNames `places`**.

- **Step 11.5 — Marriage & divorce UI** (no migration; uses the 11.1 columns):
  spouse links in the add-person flow (base "How they connect" rows +
  Task 11.4's extra-connection rows) reveal an optional **Marriage date** +
  **They later divorced** checkbox → **Divorce date**, mirroring the
  Deceased/Date-of-death pattern (`SpouseDatesFields`); the values ride the
  `ConnectionEdge` into `add_people_with_connections`. `getTreeGraph` now
  carries `id / created_by / marriage_date / is_divorced / divorce_date` on
  each edge. `PersonPanel` gains a **Family** section — spouse rows show
  "Married {date}" and a "Divorced {date}" badge, with inline editing of all
  three fields (`updateRelationshipMarriage` server action, gated by the
  existing `relationships_update` RLS = admin or the edge's creator; DB CHECKs
  keep dates coherent). The canvas draws a divorced pair with a sparser,
  fainter dash than a current marriage. The Step 11.3 modal's "Yes" still
  creates the spouse edge without dates — they're added afterwards from the
  panel (fields stay fully optional, never block save).

- **Step 11.4 — Multi-connection add-person flow** (no migration): once the
  base connection resolves, `add-person-flow` offers "connects to more people
  on the tree" — up to `MAX_EXTRA_CONNECTIONS` (10) repeatable rows, each a
  `RelationshipPicker` + parent/child/spouse select. Zod `superRefine` rejects
  a duplicate (person, type) row inline. All edges (chain + extras) go in the
  one `add_people_with_connections` transaction; detection + the Step 11.3
  modal run over the combined set. Cross-tree targets are impossible (member
  list is tree-scoped) and re-rejected by `resolve_person_ref`; the
  parent-child/spouse pair guard from 11.3 covers the new cycle case.

- **Step 11.3 — Blocking approval modal** (migration
  `20260831010000_add_person_suggestions_rpc`):
  `add_people_with_connections` gains a 4th arg `p_suggestions` — the implied
  connections the adder resolved. Each is written to `connection_suggestions`
  (`accepted` / `dismissed` / `pending` from Yes / No / Skip); an `accepted`
  spouse/parent suggestion also creates its edge, all in the one transaction
  with the new person + base edges. New guard: a pair can't be both a
  parent-child and a spouse edge (also covers Step 11.4). `add-person-flow`
  now runs `detectConnections` (server action → `detectImpliedConnections`)
  after form validation; 1+ suggestions open `ConnectionApprovalDialog` — a
  non-dismissible shadcn `Dialog`, one Yes/No/Skip row each, entry blocked
  until all answered. Still-pending suggestions surface inline on the person's
  detail panel (`PendingConnectionPrompts` in `PersonPanel`, fed by
  `listPanelSuggestions`), resolvable by the suggestion's author or an admin
  via `resolveConnectionSuggestion` → `resolve_connection_suggestion()` RPC.

- **Step 11.2 — Connection-suggestion detection engine** (no migration):
  `lib/connection-suggestions.ts#computeImpliedConnections` is a pure, read-only
  function over the pending edge set (`{ kind: "new" | "existing" }` refs) that
  proposes three patterns — `co_parent` (shared child, no edge between the
  parents → suggest `spouse`), `unlinked_spouse_child` (a pending spouse edge
  where one side has children unlinked to the other → suggest `parent`, one per
  child), and `name_dob_match` (a new person shares a surname + birth-year
  within `SIBLING_CHECK_WINDOW_YEARS` (40) with an unconnected existing person →
  suggest `sibling_check`, never an edge). It never re-emits a pair already in
  `connection_suggestions` (dedupe via `suggestionDedupeKey`, mirroring the DB
  unique key). `lib/connection-suggestions.server.ts#detectImpliedConnections`
  loads the tree's people/edges/recorded suggestions and runs it. Vitest added
  (`npm test`); `lib/connection-suggestions.test.ts` covers each pattern +
  dedupe + the never-an-edge guarantee.

- **Step 11.1 — Marriage/divorce fields + `connection_suggestions` table**
  (migration `20260831000000_marriage_divorce_and_connection_suggestions`):
  `relationships` gains `marriage_date date`, `is_divorced boolean NOT NULL
  DEFAULT false`, `divorce_date date`, with CHECKs — `divorce_date` only when
  `is_divorced`, `divorce_date >= marriage_date` when both set, and all three
  NULL/false unless `type = 'spouse'`. New `connection_suggestions` table
  (id, tree_id, subject_person_id, related_person_id, `suggested_type`
  spouse|parent|sibling_check, `source` co_parent|unlinked_spouse_child|
  name_dob_match, `status` pending|accepted|dismissed, created_by, resolved_by,
  resolved_at, created_at) with `UNIQUE (subject_person_id, related_person_id,
  suggested_type, source)` as the no-reprompt guarantee. RLS: SELECT/INSERT by
  tree membership (as self), UPDATE by the suggestion's creator or a tree admin.
  Types regenerated. Down: drop the table + the three columns/constraints.

- **Step 11 — Optional maiden name** (migration
  `20260830250000_person_maiden_name`): new nullable `people.maiden_name text`
  column (no default; existing rows stay NULL). `add_people_with_connections`
  re-created to persist it on create. Shared zod schema
  (`lib/person-schema.ts`) gains an optional `maiden_name` (≤120 chars, blank OK)
  wired into `toPersonPayload` + `emptyPersonValues`; `PersonFields` shows a
  "Maiden name" input beside the other name fields (not admin-gated), so it
  appears in both the edit form and the add-a-relative flow. `updatePerson`
  writes it. Detail panel (`PersonPanel`) shows "Maiden name" when set and — for
  an editor of an entry with no maiden name — a subtle dashed inline prompt
  linking to the edit form (opt-in, per-person, non-blocking; gated by the same
  creator/owner/admin `canEdit`). The **canvas `PersonNode` does not** display
  it. Search: `listTreeMembers` + `TreeMemberOption` carry `maidenName`, and the
  `RelationshipPicker` search box matches it alongside the display name (and
  shows "· née …" on matching rows). `lib/database.types.ts` regenerated.

- **Step 10 — Privacy, acceptance & ship**: no migration. Consent gate on the
  magic-link form + `/privacy` notice; admin JSON export, admin delete-person
  (+ storage cleanup), self-serve delete-account (`app/actions/privacy.ts`,
  `components/{admin-export,delete-account}.tsx`); 10MB document cap; full v1
  acceptance checklist verified. `proxy.ts` public prefixes gain `/privacy`.
- **Step 9 — Multi-tree seam, polish & admin dashboard** (migration
  `20260830240000_multi_tree_seam`): new `tree_bridges` table (RLS: members of
  either side) + `start_own_tree(name, bridge_person_id, person)` SECURITY
  DEFINER RPC that creates a member's own `trees` row, their root `people` row
  in it, and one spouse bridge back to a person on a tree they already belong
  to (one per member). Gated by `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_MULTI_TREE` via
  `lib/flags.ts#multiTreeEnabled`; the second tree is **not** drawn — this is a
  clean seam for v2. UI: `/trees/new` (`components/start-tree-form.tsx`,
  `app/actions/trees.ts#startOwnTree`), plus a flagged "Start your own tree"
  button on the canvas. Polish: `components/ui/skeleton.tsx` +
  `app/{tree,admin,account}/loading.tsx` route skeletons, wrapping/focus-ring
  fixes in `site-header.tsx`. Admin dashboard (`/admin`): an Overview stat grid
  (members, entries, relationships, claimed, unverified, open flags, disputes,
  bridges) and a per-member "Entries created" column.
- **Step 8 — Entry comments, flags & verification** (migration
  `20260830230000`): `people` gains `verified_at` / `verified_by`;
  `entry_comments` gains `resolved_at` / `resolved_by`. Any tree member can
  comment or raise a flag (`is_flag`) — inserted directly under the existing
  `entry_comments` RLS (optimistic UI). An `AFTER INSERT/UPDATE` trigger
  (`private.entry_comment_notify`) posts an in-app `notifications` row to the
  entry's `owner_user_id` + `created_by` on every comment/flag, and to the
  flag's author when it is resolved (new notification types `entry_commented`,
  `entry_flagged`, `flag_resolved`, `entry_verified`). `resolve_entry_flag()`
  (owner / admin / flag author) toggles a flag open↔resolved; the
  `entry_comments_update` policy is widened so the entry owner can moderate.
  `set_entry_verified()` (admins only) stamps verification and notifies. UI:
  `EntryComments` panel section (thread + composer + resolve), open-flag badge
  on `PersonNode` + panel header, `✓` verified marker on the node, admin
  "Mark verified" in the panel. `getTreeGraph` now also loads open-flag counts;
  `lib/entry-comments.ts` resolves author/resolver names.
- **Step 7 — Claiming & permissions** (migration `20260830220000`): edit gating
  is now owner / admin / unclaimed-creator (`private.can_edit_person` +
  `private.person_is_claimed`), enforced by the existing `people_update` policy
  and re-checked in the `/people/[id]/edit` route. `person_claim_candidates()`
  surfaces unclaimed same-name entries; `claim_person()` (SECURITY DEFINER)
  auto-approves — moves `owner_user_id`, repoints `profiles.self_person_id`,
  merges the caller's onboarding stub (relationships / documents / comments /
  photo) and deletes it, writes an `approved` `claims` row, and notifies the
  creator. `dispute_claim()` (creator only) → `disputed`, routed to admins;
  `resolve_claim(uphold|reverse)` (admin) restores ownership + detaches the
  claimant on reverse. New `notifications` table + `private.notify()`; abuse
  controls: 5 claims / 24h / user, server-side name-match re-check, admin-only
  reversal. UI: `ClaimSuggestions` canvas prompt, claim/dispute in
  `PersonPanel`, account `NotificationsList` (+ header unread badge), admin
  `AdminDisputedClaims`.
- **Step 6 — Tree visualization (canvas)**: `/tree` is now a React Flow
  (`@xyflow/react`) + dagre canvas. `lib/tree.ts#getTreeGraph` loads all people
  (with 1h signed photo URLs) + relationship edges for the shared tree;
  `lib/tree-layout.ts#layoutTree` is a pure, client-safe dagre pass — top-down by
  generation, with invisible "union" nodes tying couples to one rank and hanging
  their children from a shared point; pinned `people.pos_x/pos_y` override the
  auto position. `components/tree/`: `family-tree.tsx` (canvas + pan/zoom /
  minimap / controls, drag-to-pin via `setPersonPosition` server action),
  `person-node.tsx` (photo/initials, name + `née` maiden name / birth year
  / birthplace, dashed deceased styling, self-highlight), `person-panel.tsx` (shadcn Sheet — full details,
  documents, disabled Edit/Claim stubs for Steps 7–8). Empty state links into
  the Step 5 onboarding / add-relative flow. New dep: `dagre`.
- **Step 5 — Connections & add-person flow**: `add_people_with_connections`
  SECURITY DEFINER RPC (migration `20260830210000`) creates one or more people
  plus their `parent`/`spouse` edges in a single transaction, links the caller's
  `self_person_id` when `p_self_index` is set, guards against parent/child cycles
  (recursive walk), and — for non-admins — rejects the write unless every new
  person reaches a pre-existing tree member (admins seed roots freely). Replaces
  `create_self_person` (dropped). `sibling_edges` security-invoker view exposes
  sibling pairs from shared parents; `lib/siblings.ts` mirrors it client-side.
  New `AddPersonFlow` (self + relative modes) with `RelationshipPicker`
  search-select and inline chain-add of missing in-between people; `/onboarding`
  now requires a connection, `/people/new` adds relatives. `PersonForm` is now
  edit-only; demographic fields extracted to `PersonFields`.
- **Step 4 — Person form & onboarding**: reusable `PersonForm` (shadcn Form +
  zod, `lib/person-schema.ts`); required = (given|preferred) + family +
  country_of_birth + explicit `is_deceased`; death fields revealed on the
  Deceased checkbox; admin-only Lineage select. Client-side photo
  downscale (`lib/image.ts`) → `photos` bucket; multi-file Documents section
  (`person-documents.tsx`) → `documents` bucket with signed-URL download +
  remove. First-run onboarding at `/onboarding` (guarded by
  `requireSelfPerson`) creates the member's own person via the
  `create_self_person` SECURITY DEFINER RPC (migration `20260830200539`) which
  also sets `profiles.self_person_id`. `next.config.ts` allows the Supabase
  Storage image host.
- **Step 3 — Auth & invite system**: magic-link auth + invite-gated
  registration; `redeem_invite` / `ensure_profile` / `invite_preview` RPCs +
  `admin_allowlist` bootstrap (both co-admins seeded) + `member_directory` view
  (migrations `20260830192758`, `20260830192832`, `20260830194512`); `/join`, `/join/[token]`,
  `/auth/callback`, `/account`, `/admin`; `lib/auth.ts`, `lib/site-url.ts`,
  `app/actions/{auth,invites}.ts`; auth-aware `SiteHeader`.
- **Step 2 — Data model, RLS & storage**: `supabase init` + link to
  Product-Ancestree; first migrations for all tables, RLS, and private
  `photos` / `documents` buckets; generated `lib/database.types.ts`.
- **Step 1 — Repo & infra bootstrap**: Next.js 16 + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui
  scaffold; Public Sans; Supabase client/server/middleware/admin helpers
  (env-guarded); `.env.example`; landing + `/tree` placeholder + `/join`;
  GitHub repo `arattansi/ancestree`; Product-Ancestree (`kkmemshpkxrzogijxgnb`);
  Vercel Hobby project `ancestree` (`prj_tfdWlxVA1Wu6tbiLquXMjso5wTap`) +
  `ancestree.space` / `www.ancestree.space`; this doc.

**Step 1 infra notes:** `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is server-only. Set it in
`.env.local` and Vercel from Supabase Project Settings → API (service_role).
Do not commit it. Preview env vars may need a git branch in this CLI version.
