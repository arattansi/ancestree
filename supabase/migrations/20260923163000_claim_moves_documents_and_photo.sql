-- Step 43 — "This is me" with a document on the placeholder
--
-- `claim_person` (Step 36) merges the member's own placeholder into the entry
-- they claim, then deletes it. It moved the placeholder's documents with a
-- plain update, and since Step 41.3 `documents_guard` lets a document change
-- entries only under the privileged flag: 'A document stays where it was
-- uploaded'. So "This is me" failed whenever the placeholder had a document,
-- even one the member uploaded, and the app said only "Couldn't complete that
-- claim. Try again."
--
-- It also copied the placeholder's `photo_path` onto a claimed entry with no
-- photo, but the file stayed in the placeholder's folder
-- (`<tree>/<placeholder>/<file>`), and `storage_photos_select` lets someone
-- read a photo only if they can see the entry its path names. Nobody can once
-- the placeholder is deleted, so the claimed entry showed no photo.
--
-- 1. `claim_person` — moves the documents under the privileged flag, saving
--    and restoring its previous value as `merge_invited_entry` does, once the
--    claimed entry is theirs. They stop being shared across trees, as in Step
--    41.3's merge: the claimed entry may be shown on trees the placeholder
--    never was, and a choice made for the placeholder's trees shouldn't reach
--    them. The member can share them again, as the person. Their tree never
--    changes. The photo, when the claimed entry has none, is named under the
--    claimed entry's id instead, framed as it was (`photo_crop` comes too),
--    and the call returns both paths for `claimPerson` to move the file with
--    the service role. A photo kept anywhere but the placeholder's own folder
--    stays behind. Step 36's placeholder and has-died guards, and the rest of
--    the merge, are unchanged.
--
-- The live body of `claim_person` was checked against 20260923100000 first
-- (md5 identical).
